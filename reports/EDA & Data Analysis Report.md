## 1. Introduction and Objectives
### Introduction
Music has long been recognized for its potential to impact emotional and psychological well-being. As digital music consumption increases, understanding how music influences mental health is increasingly relevant. This report analyzes data from the Music and Mental Health dataset to explore the relationship between music preferences, listening habits, and mental health conditions.

### Objectives:
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- Examine how different demographic factors such as age and musical background influence music preferences and mental health.
- Analyze the relationship between music listening habits, such as hours spent listening and preferred genres, and their effects on mental health.
- Identify patterns and correlations between music preferences and self-reported mental health conditions to provide insights into how music may influence mental well-being.

## 2. Data Overview

The dataset includes information on demographic variables, music preferences, musical background and Engagement with Music, listening habits, and self-reported mental health conditions. \
The dataset contains 728 rows and 31 columns. Seven columns are numerical and the rest are categorical.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 3.1. Demographics
---
- **Age Distribution**\
The dataset reveals a predominance of younger respondents, particularly between **14 and 27 years old**. This age group is likely to have distinct music preferences and listening habits compared to older populations. For instance, younger individuals may gravitate towards genres like Rock and Pop due to their popularity and cultural trends within this demographic. Additionally, younger people are more likely to use modern streaming services, which could affect the frequency and context of their music consumption.

### 4.2. Preferred BPM and Music Effect
---
The boxplot analysis of the relationship between Beats Per Minute (BPM) and music's effect shows:
- **Improvement:** BPM ranges between 100 and 140.
- **No Effect:** BPM ranges between 110 and 135.
- **Worsening:** BPM ranges between 112 and 130.

All categories exhibit some *outliers* indicating that individual responses to music's tempo can vary. \
The overlap in BPM ranges across different outcomes suggests that while moderate tempos are generally preferred, the impact of music on mental health varies and *is not solely dependent on BPM*.

### 4.3. Listening Hours and Music Effect
---
The dotplot shows that more hours of music listening generally lead to improved well-being. Most responses cluster between 0 and 5 hours, with improvement seen even at higher durations. There are also more instances of no effect at longer listening times, but no worsening is observed with extended listening hours.

### 4.4. Musical Background and Music Effect
---
Analyzing the relationship between being a musician and the effect of music, there is no clear distinction in music's impact between musicians and non-musicians, as the majority in both groups report improvement.

### 4.5. Music effect on Mental health
---
- **Anxiety & Depression:** Moderate to high levels (4-8 for anxiety, 2-7 for depression) show improvement, but higher levels (5-8 for anxiety, 5-10 for depression) may worsen symptoms.
- **OCD & Insomnia:** Lower levels (0-5 for OCD, 1-6 for insomnia) benefit from music, but higher levels (1-5 for OCD, 3-7 for insomnia) may worsen.

The data indicates that music's impact on mental health varies **by condition and severity**, with consistent patterns and no outliers suggesting reliable insights.

### 4.6. Correlation Matrix
---
Analyzing the correlation matrix reveals that the variable music_effects shows a notable positive correlation with favorite_genre (0.13) and a negative correlation with while_working (-0.16). It also has a slight negative correlation with exploratory (-0.15).

The negative correlation between music_effects and while_working suggests that although music is frequently listened to during work, it may not always positively impact mental health in this context. This implies that music's effect on mental well-being could vary depending on whether it is used for relaxation or work-related tasks. Further investigation into how different types of music or listening settings affect mental health could provide more insights.

Additionally, mental illnesses exhibit strong correlations with each other for example Depression and Anxiety (0.52), Depression and Insomnia (0.37), and Anxiety and OCD (0.35).
These correlations suggest that individuals experiencing one mental health condition are more likely to experience others, highlighting the interrelated nature of these conditions.

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis of the Music and Mental Health dataset provides valuable insights into how music preferences, listening habits, and musical background relate to mental well-being. Key findings include:

1. **Demographics and Music Preferences**: Younger respondents (14-27 years) predominantly favor Rock, Pop, and Metal, with Rock being the most popular genre.

2. **Listening Habits and Mental Health**: Most respondents listen to music daily, with 1 to 3.5 hours being the average duration. Music is often part of their work routine, contributing positively to mental health, partcularly to anxiety and depression.

3. **Musical Background and Engagement**: A significant portion of respondents are either musicians or deeply engaged with music, such as exploring new genres or enjoying music in foreign languages. However, the impact of music on mental health does not show a strong distinction between musicians and non-musicians.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation matrix indicates that music_effects is positively correlated with favorite_genre (0.13) and negatively correlated with while_working (-0.16) and exploratory (-0.15). The strong correlations between mental health conditions suggest that individuals with one condition are more likely to experience others. Besides, the tempo of the music (BPM) and the number of hours spent listening also play a role in influencing mental health, but the effects are not solely dependent on these factors.

5. **Musicâ€™s Impact on Mental Health**: Overall, music tends to have a positive effect on well-being for a majority of respondents. However, its impact varies by mental health condition and severity, suggesting that while music generally benefits mental health, the effect can differ based on individual circumstances.

In summary, the relationship between music and mental health is multifaceted, with various factors such as age, genre preference, listening habits, and mental health conditions influencing how individuals respond to music. These findings suggest that personalized music therapy could be an effective approach to enhancing mental well-being, particularly when tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the individual.

## 6. Recommendations:

1. **For Anxiety and Depression:** Individuals experiencing anxiety and depression may benefit from listening to genres such as Rock and Pop, which are preferred by respondents with these conditions. Additionally, moderate BPMs (100-140) appear to be associated with improvements in mental well-being.

2. **For Insomnia and OCD:** While music can be beneficial, its effects on insomnia and OCD may vary. It might be useful to explore specific music types or listening durations that could help alleviate symptoms of these conditions.

3. **General Music Therapy:** Personalized music therapy programs could be developed to address individual needs based on their music preferences and mental health conditions. Tailoring music therapy to match the specific genres and listening habits of individuals may enhance its effectiveness.

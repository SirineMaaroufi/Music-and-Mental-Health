# Data Preparation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the data preparation steps taken to clean and prepare the Music and Mental Health dataset for further analysis. The process involves loading the dataset, cleaning the data, handling missing values and outliers, renaming columns, adjusting data types, and saving the cleaned data.

## Steps

### 1. Loading Data
The dataset was loaded from a CSV file using the `load_data()` function. This function takes the file path as an input and returns the dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

### 2. Dropping Unnecessary Columns
Columns that were not needed for analysis, such as `Permissions` and `Timestamp`, were removed using the `drop_unnecessary_columns()` function. This helped to streamline the dataset and focus on relevant information.

### 3. Renaming Columns
To improve readability and consistency, several columns were renamed using the `rename_columns()` function. For example, `Age` was renamed to `age`, and `Primary streaming service` was renamed to `streaming_service`.

### 4. Handling Missing Values
- Missing values in the `music_effects` column were removed as they were critical for analysis.
- Missing values in categorical columns were imputed using the most frequent category, leveraging the `impute_missing_categorical()` function.
- The `bpm` column had missing values imputed based on the corresponding `favorite_genre`, using the `impute_bpm()` function and a predefined mapping of genres to average BPM values.
- The `age` column was imputed with the mean value using the `impute_missing_age()` function.

### 5. Adjusting Data Types
Data types were adjusted for better processing:
- Categorical columns were converted to the 'category' type.
- Columns such as `age`, `anxiety`, `depression`, `insomnia`, and `ocd` were converted to integer types using the `adjust_data_types()` function.

### 6. Detecting and Handling Outliers
- Outliers in the `age` and `bpm` columns were detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, implemented in the `detect_outliers_iqr()` function.
- Extreme outliers in `bpm` were handled by imputing them with the mean BPM of the corresponding `favorite_genre`. This decision was made under the assumption that extreme values are likely errors, as most people are not aware of the exact BPM of their favorite genre.
- Outliers in the `age` column were retained, as they were deemed valid and did not significantly distort the data.

### 7. Saving Cleaned Data
The cleaned dataset was saved to a specified file path using the `save_cleaned_data()` function. This ensures that the data is ready for subsequent analysis.

## Conclusion
These data preparation steps have resulted in a cleaned and well-structured dataset, ready for further exploration and modeling tasks.
